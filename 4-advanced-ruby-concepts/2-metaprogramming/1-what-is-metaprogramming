What is Metaprogramming?

Metaprogramming means writing code that writes code — Ruby lets you manipulate classes, methods, and objects at runtime.
This is widely used in Rails (ActiveRecord, DSLs, validations, etc.).

Interview one-liner:
“Metaprogramming in Ruby lets us dynamically create or modify methods, classes, and behavior at runtime, which is the foundation of Rails magic.”
