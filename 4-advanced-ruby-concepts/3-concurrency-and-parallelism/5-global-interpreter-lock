Global Interpreter Lock (GIL)

MRI Ruby uses a GIL (Global Interpreter Lock) → only one thread executes Ruby code at a time.

Reason: Simplifies memory management.

But I/O-bound tasks benefit (while one thread waits, another can run).

Interview Question: “Does Ruby support parallel threads?”
Answer: “In MRI Ruby, threads run concurrently but not in parallel due to GIL. For true parallelism, we use Ractors or JRuby.”
