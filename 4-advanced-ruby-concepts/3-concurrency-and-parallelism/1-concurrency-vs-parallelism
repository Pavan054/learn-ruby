Concurrency vs Parallelism

Concurrency: Multiple tasks make progress by interleaving execution (not necessarily at the same time).

Parallelism: Multiple tasks run simultaneously (true parallel execution on multi-core CPUs).

Ruby (MRI) supports concurrency well, but parallelism is limited due to the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL).
