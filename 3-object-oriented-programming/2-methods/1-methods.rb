### Methods

# A method is a set of instructions grouped together to perform a task.
# In Ruby, everything is done by calling methods (even operators like + are methods).

puts 5.+(3)  # 8
puts 5 + 3   # Same thing, syntactic sugar

## Interview tip: Mention that everything is an object, and method calls are messages to objects in Ruby.
