Modules

What are Modules?

    - A collection of methods, constants, and classes.
    - Cannot be instantiated (unlike classes).
    - Used for:
        - Namespaces → avoid naming conflicts.
        - Mixins → add reusable behavior to classes.
        - Grouping constants logically.

Interview Tip:
If they ask “What’s the difference between a class and a module?” →
    - Classes can be instantiated, support inheritance.
    - Modules cannot be instantiated, no inheritance, but can be mixed in.
