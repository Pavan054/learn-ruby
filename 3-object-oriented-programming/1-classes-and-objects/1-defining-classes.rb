## Defining Classes

# Class → Blueprint for creating objects (defines attributes & behaviors).
# Object → Instance of a class with its own data.

# Use the class keyword.
# Class names in Ruby use CamelCase.

# Interview tip: In Ruby, everything is an object (even classes themselves are objects of class Class).
# Interesting fact: Classes can be reopened and modified later in Ruby (open classes).
